Proxmox Integration for WemX

Note: The new and improved Proxmox version is currently in beta. It’s not fully stable yet, but it can be used publicly. Just be aware that order processing (such as cloning) may take a few minutes in this version.

Start Selling Proxmox VMs with WemX

With this integration, users can purchase a VM, and WemX will automatically create it using the Proxmox API. In addition, WemX will generate a user account on the Proxmox panel and grant the customer direct access to manage their server from there.

You can also manage power actions directly from WemX—such as starting, stopping, shutting down, and rebooting the VM. WemX further provides insights into VM resource usage, including memory, disk space, CPU, and more.
